## Make Frank Stand: A Matter.js character simulation.  
**NB: Still a work in progress, far from finish, but basic features work well enough.**  
This project is an interactive physics based simulation built with [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/). It features a character (Frank) made up of rigid bodies and constraints with user based dynamics and state-based logic surrounding each body.  

## Why this exists.
I got the idea of making a rage-inducing game into my head, and coincidentally, I started looking into working with physics engines. The concept is pretty simple too. Make Frank Stand. The stickman character, Frank, has disproportionate body parts. The goal as the user is to make him stay upright for five seconds (the hard part). 

## What it does (so far).
- Ragdoll-like character simulation.
- Buttons to control movements of body parts (head and legs).
- Disables movement if certain conditions are met e.g if character is too low or if a leg is too far.
- Countdown function to implement level success or failure.
- Detects part distance and updates UI accordingly.

## Soon to come.
- A **lot** of visual polish.
- Actual difficulty levels which includes progression and reset.
- Score tracking.
- Sound effects and win/fail feedback
- Deployment (Github pages).

## How to Run.
